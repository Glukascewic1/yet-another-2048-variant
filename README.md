# Yet Another 2048 Variant
A small clone of 2048 Hex. Merge three '1' tiles to get a '3' tile. Two tiles with sum of 3 or the same number touch greater than 3 or equal to 3 can merge.
## Update
I cloned this from <strong>2048++</strong>. (I found it on the App Store :smile:) 2048++ is hands down the cleanest, most responsive 2048 app for Android.

That screenshot wasn't from my game, by the way. It was Gabriele's 2048 :smile:
## Donations
I made this in my spare time, and it's hosted on Github (which means I created many 2048 variants), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me choclate, you can donate at my BTC address: `londage2013@gmail.com`. Thank you very much!
